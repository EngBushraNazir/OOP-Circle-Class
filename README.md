# OOP Laboratory Tasks (C++)

🚀 **My First GitHub Repository**
يحتوي هذا المستودع على مهام مختبر البرمجة كائنية التوجه (OOP) المنفذة بلغة ++C،
ويشمل حاليًا مهام المختبرات من Lab 1 إلى Lab 14.
يُعد هذا أول مستودع لي على GitHub، وقد قمت بإنشائه لتوثيق رحلتي التعليمية وتطوير مهاراتي البرمجية.
This repository contains all my **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) laboratory tasks** implemented in **C++**.  
It is my first repository on GitHub, created to document my learning journey and improve my programming skills.

## 📁 LAB 8 – make a person class and inherit student class from person class.
- [Lab 8 ](Lab-8-Task.txt)

## 📁 LAB 9 – Make a FIFO Class then make a FIFO2 class that is inherited from FIFO Class
- [Lab 9 ](Lab-9-Task.txt)

## 📁 LAB 10 – Make an Electric_Car and Petrol_Car class, Make an Hybrid_Car class that is inherited from first two classes.
- [Lab 10 ](Lab-10-Task.txt)

## 📁 LAB 11 – Create a class Shape that has three pure virtual functions as shown in the UML Diagram
- [Lab 11 ](Lab-11-Task.txt)

## 📁 LAB 12 – Create a class Length that has two attributes Feet as integer and Inches. Define friend * operator outside the class to Multiply two Length Objects.
- [Lab 12 ](Lab-12-Task.txt)

## 📁 LAB 13 – Make an Employee class. It has two attributes
o	id as unsigned int
o	name as a character array of size 100.
o	total as static integer to show total number of employees
o	Set the initial value of total equals to 0.
Make static void show_total() to show total number of employees.
- [Lab 13 ](Lab-13-Task.txt)

## 📁 LAB 14 –  Make an Employee class.
•	It has two attributes: Name as character array and Salary as an integer.
•	Make Add() function that takes Name and Salary and store in a File named “employees.xt”
•	Make Show_All() function that shows Names of All Employees and their Salary on screen by reading data from “employees.xt” file.
•	Make Search() function that searches Name of Employee on screen by reading data from “employees.xt” file.
•	Note: Use Formatted File I/O. Inside “employees.xt” file one line should contain data of one employee only.
